# Interact with authentications methods

To interact with your various authentication methods, you can use the `GraphQL API`, which by default provides `mutations`for signing up, logging in, and logging out. Hereâ€™s how you can perform these three actions:

When logging in or out, the inputs you pass as parameters to the mutation correspond to the `inputs` defined during the configuration of the `authentication` method. When logging in or signing up, a session is created (if you have chosen a session system based on cookies, a cookie will also be created).

## Sign up

```graphql
mutation signUpWith {
  signUpWith(
    input: {authentication: {emailPassword: {email: "your.email@gmail.com", password: "password"}}}
  ) {
    id
    accessToken
		refreshToken
  }
}
```

## Sign in

```graphql
mutation signInWith {
  signInWith(
    input: {authentication: {emailPassword: {email: "your.email@gmail.com", password: "password"}}}
  ) {
    id
    accessToken
    refreshToken
  }
}
```

## Sign out

```graphql
mutation signOut{
  signOut
}
```
